evernote-mode
=============

Emacs interface for Evernote which originally started on
[Google Code][1].  Then it was [updated][2] for working with Ruby
1.9.3 and Emacs 24.1.  Which was then updated to [work with OAuth][3].
Then just a little bit of Emacs customization niceness was added.

INSTALLATION
------------

You will need to install the Evernote OAUTH Ruby gems in order to get
all of this stuff working.  Run the following command:

    gem install evernote_oauth



CONFIGURATION
-------------

You'll need to get a production developer token from [Evernote][4] and
in Emacs set the custom variable `evernote-developer-token`.  If
`evernote-mode` is loaded this can be done easily with `M-x
customize-group evernote`.
